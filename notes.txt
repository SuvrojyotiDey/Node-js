[___________Fundamentals to understand_____________]

JavaScript engine is nothing but a program which converts js code into machine code.
Ryan Dahl saw the potential in Chrome's V8 engine and took it outside the browser and modified it with his own C++ code to make Node JS.
Node js is a js runtime powered by chrome's v8 engine which can run outside browser i.e web server.

JavaScript is a single threaded language.Which means one process at a time.
so in context to serving a request from a client the thread will be be blocked until the request is resolved.
This will lead to increase in wait time for the other process.
To make the things run smoothly we use the concept of no blocking io with workers which will assist the single thread.
Here the concept of workers comes from libuv which is a library made for node js which gives us the concept of non blocking io.
Which uses the system kernel i.e the program that controls the entire operating system. this kernel has multiple threads.
So Libuv uses system kernel to make multiple threads.Hence worker here are threads. 
so when client makes a request it will be handled in a single threaded way but behind the scene multiple threads will be used.   

One disadvantage of Node js is not suitable for high processing task.It is suitable for I/O related task 
i.e db, network,file related task.
